## Quick Install

### Requirements
- PHP 8.0+
- MySQL 8.0
- Apache or Nginx with PHP-FPM
- Local stack: XAMPP / Laragon / MAMP

### Steps

1. Copy the project folder into your web server root  
   (e.g. `htdocs/sentri-system/` for XAMPP)

2. Configure `config/email.php`:
   - Set your Gmail App Password credentials (see instructions inside the file)
   - Set `APP_URL` **only if** you want to pin a specific address (see note below)

3. Run the installer in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost/sentri-system/install.php
   ```
   This creates the `sentri` database and all tables automatically, including
   all community columns and the full role ENUM.

4. **Delete `install.php`** immediately after successful installation.

5. Access the system:
   - Community:    `http://localhost/sentri-system/`
   - Admin panel:  `http://localhost/sentri-system/admin.php`
   - Default admin: set via `install.php` on first run — change immediately after setup
   ⚠️  Change the admin password immediately after first login.

## Email Verification Links - Dynamic APP_URL

Email links (account verification, password reset) are built using `APP_URL`
defined in `config/email.php`.

**The default value is `http://localhost` which is a placeholder only.**

### How auto-detection works

`core/SenTriMailer.php` checks whether `APP_URL` is still the default placeholder
at runtime. If it is, `sentri_detect_app_url()` reads the live HTTP request to
build the correct base URL automatically:

| Scenario | Auto-detected link |
|---|---|
| XAMPP default | `http://localhost/sentri-system` |
| Custom port | `http://localhost:8080/sentri-system` |
| Live domain (root) | `https://sentri.example.com` |
| Live domain (subdir) | `https://example.com/sentri` |
| Reverse proxy | Reads `X-Forwarded-Proto` / `X-Forwarded-Host` |

### When to set APP_URL manually

You only need to set `APP_URL` explicitly when:
- Your server sits behind a proxy that does **not** set forwarding headers
- You run background/CLI scripts that send emails (no live `$_SERVER` available)
- You want to enforce a canonical URL regardless of how PHP detects the host

Example in `config/email.php`:
```php
// Production domain - remove this line to use auto-detection
define('APP_URL', 'https://sentri.example.com');
```

Leave it as `http://localhost` to keep auto-detection active everywhere.

## Features

### Community (Registered Users)
- Submit geo-tagged incident reports with title, category, severity status, and location pin
- Attach up to 3 photos per report (JPG, PNG, WEBP - max 5 MB each)
- Adjustable affected radius slider (50 m to 3 km)
- Upvote / downvote reports for community credibility scoring
- Interactive Leaflet.js map with colour-coded severity overlays
- In-app GTA-style heading-up navigation to report locations (no Google Maps redirect), with auto-arrival detection
- Filter feed by status, category, or keyword
- Dark / light mode toggle

### Role-Based Portals
- **Community** - report submission, feed browsing, map view
- **Barangay Official** - barangay-scoped report management
- **LGU** - city/municipal-level report oversight
- **First Responder** - BFP / PNP / EMS response view (with responder type)
- **Admin** - full moderation, user management, audit log, security monitor

Official roles (Barangay, LGU, First Responder) skip email verification and go
through administrator approval instead.

### Admin Panel
- Moderate reports (archive / restore / delete)
- Manage user accounts and roles; approve pending official accounts
- Emergency Contacts directory - LGU offices, hospitals, traffic, police, fire
- Reports Audit Log - full create/edit/delete history
- Security Monitor tab - failed login tracking, suspicious activity

### Automatic Notifications
When a **Dangerous** report is submitted, `api/contacts.php` emails all active
emergency contacts whose city (and optionally barangay) matches the report location.

## Security Notes

- `config/` is protected by `.htaccess` (direct web access denied)
- `uploads/` blocks PHP execution via `.htaccess`
- All DB queries use prepared statements with bound parameters
- Passwords hashed with `password_hash()` at bcrypt cost 12
- Role-based session checks on every protected page and API endpoint
- Rate limiting: 10 reports per user per hour
- Failed login attempts tracked; Security Monitor tab surfaces suspicious IPs
